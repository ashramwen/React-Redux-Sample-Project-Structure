This project is based on a very good article written by Ashwin Nayar.  He did a great job writting the article but was not consistent with the codes having mistakes that can be frustrating to new ReactJS developers.  

I spent a couple of hours to debug the code in the article and made it work but during that couple of hours I almost gave up due to the code being unintentionally misleading.

In spite of that, the article helped me organize my code so thank you Aswin Nayar. 

To start running the code, please clone and run "npm install" before doing an "npm start".
